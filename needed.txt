These are the basic functions and types I need for my own projects:

constants:
- SDL_JOYBUTTONDOWN
- SDL_JOYBUTTONUP
+ SDL_GL_RED_SIZE (from SDL_video.h)
+ SDL_GL_GREEN_SIZE   ||
+ SDL_GL_BLUE_SIZE    ||
+ SDL_GL_DEPTH_SIZE   ||
+ SDL_GL_DOUBLEBUFFER ||


These come with a bunch of keyboard constants:
- SDL_KEYDOWN
- SDL_KEYUP


types:

- SDL_Joystick
- SDL_Event (and member types)
+ SDL_Window (SDL_video.h I think)
+ SDL_GLContext (SDL_video.h)

functions:

- SDL_NumJoysticks
+ SDL_IsGameController
- SDL_JoystickOpen
- SDL_JoystickNumAxes
- SDL_JoystickGetAxis
- SDL_Init
+ SDL_CreateWindow
+ SDL_GL_CreateContext
+ SDL_GL_SetAttribute
+ SDL_GetTicks
+ SDL_PollEvent
+ SDL_GL_SwapWindow
